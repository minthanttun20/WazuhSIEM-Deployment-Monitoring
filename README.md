# WazuhSIEM-Deployment-Monitoring
A hands-on implementation of a Security Operations Center (SOC) using the Wazuh SIEM platform to monitor a Windows endpoint.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a centralized security monitoring system. I deployed a Wazuh Manager on Ubuntu to collect, analyze, and alert on telemetry from a Windows 10 Agent.

##🛠️ Core Features Tested
Authentication Security: Detected and alerted on Brute Force (Failed Login) attempts.

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Real-time tracking of file creations and modifications in sensitive directories.

Endpoint Analysis: Monitored system startups, shutdowns, and agent connection states.
